			<h2>Orangelight Feedback</h2>
		</div>
		<p>First of all, congratulations on the beta launch! It is hard to
			overstate how much of an improvement the new system is over the
			legacy one. Great work.</p>
		<p>Apologies for not providing feedback during earlier phases of
			development, but I do have a few questions/observations that have
			been gathering dust in the back of my mind, so I thought I would go
			ahead and share them—better late than never? Sorry in
			advance if these points have already been addressed.</p>
		<ol>
			<li class="item">Are there plans to incorporate authorities data
				into the catalog interface? This data has long been hidden from
				users, and exposing it would enhance access. <ul>
					<li class="item">In particular, I was impressed by the work
						on authorities browsing in Blacklight being done at
						Cornell, as presented at Code4Lib (<a class="link_ref"
							href="http://2016.code4lib.org/Building-a-userfriendly-authorities-browse-in-Blacklight"
							>http://2016.code4lib.org/Building-a-userfriendly-authorities-browse-in-Blacklight</a>).</li>
					<li class="item">Are there plans to index series access
						points for browsing/collocation? Ditto for uniform
						titles (but see below under “labels”)?</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li class="item">Linked Data/RDF<ul>
					<li class="item">What about URI design for future linked
						data integration? For example, when/if PUL catalog data
						is converted to RDF, what will the canonical URIs look
						like? The current <a class="link_ref"
							href="https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/9575320"
							>https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/9575320</a>
						is clean, but do we want platform-specific branding like
						“pulsearch” in a canonical URI? (See, for example, <a
							class="link_ref"
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/"
							>https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/</a> for best
						practices.) Why not just <a class="link_ref"
							href="https://library.princeton.edu/catalog/9575320"
							>https://library.princeton.edu/catalog/9575320</a>?
						The branding would seem to suggest that the catalog is
						still being thought of as a discrete system rather than
						just another view onto a larger data graph. In general,
						it might be good to have a broader discussion—at least
						in terms of information sharing, if nothing else—about
						the steps that are currently being taken to build linked
						data readiness into PUL’s evolving
						systems/platforms.</li>
					<li class="item">Are there plans to integrate more robust
						RDFa markup into the HTML views? It looks as though only
						out-of-the-box Blacklight RDFa is currently included?
						This would seem to be fairly low-hanging fruit and a way
						to (potentially) boost SEO and integrate PUL catalog
						data into the wider Web, etc., etc. </li>
				</ul></li>
			<li class="item">Labels<ul>
					<li class="item">Relationship designators. +1 for this.
						However, are there plans to display multiples
						relationship designators? Currently, it seems that only
						the last one (which might not be the “most important”)
						is being displayed. For example, in <a class="link_ref"
							href="https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/9575320"
							>https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/9575320</a>,
						Leon Hirszman is both the film director and the
						screenwriter, but is only labeled as the
						screenwriter.</li>
					<li class="item">“Uniform Title.” Minor point, but “Uniform
						title” is an obsolete term no longer used under current
						(RDA) cataloging rules. A more “correct” label would be
						“Authorized access point.” </li>
					<li class="item">“Form genre” as a label doesn’t make much
						sense. Should at least be “Form/genre.”</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li class="item">Content/media/carrier type(s). So, RDA has the 3xx
				fields for indicating content, media, and carrier type(s) of a
				resource. Are these currently being used in any way? Users might
				like to know, for example, that a resource is primarily a moving
				image/DVD, but that it also contains text/printed material.
				Again, see <a class="link_ref"
					href="https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/9575320"
					>https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/9575320</a> for an
				example. The predominant format could be taken from the leader,
				then more granular info could be derived from 3xx fields.</li>
			<li class="item">Geo browse. To be supported at a later date? Would
				be great to see some use made of those pesky 043 codes I keep
				typing.</li>
			<li class="item">Speaking of pesky MARC fields: bibliographic
				references. Maybe a facet for resources that include
				bibliographic references? Do users care about this?</li>
			<li class="item">Potential bug? See <a class="link_ref"
					href="https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/9574948"
					>https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/9574948</a>, which
				includes an “Other versions” link that is not present in the
				MARC data. Further, it links to a seemingly unrelated resource.
				Same publisher, but otherwise unrelated. Unclear what’s going on
				there.</li>
		</ol><p>Please let me know if I can follow up on or clarify any of these
			points. Keep up the good work!</p>
