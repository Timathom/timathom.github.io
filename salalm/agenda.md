# SALALM 62
## Cataloging and Bibliographic Technology Submittee meeting
### May 20, 2017

#### Meeting agenda
* Intros (16 attendees)
* No updates from members

* Update on the new PCC recommendation to remove ISBD punctuation from MARC records
  * John Wright, Brigham Young University

Update on PCC recommendation for removing ISBD:
Through 2018, evaluating and testing. Good to be aware of. Moving toward more data-centric cataloging. Using subfields instead of ISBD punctuation.

TT:
Developers at PUL strip out punctuation, so already obsolete practice
 
Harvard will be moving to Alma in 2018

JW: 
Learning from RDA that we had to do a lot ourselves. Vendors waiting to see what will happen.

Pedersen:
Looking forward to see what OCLC does with it.

JW:
Problem with all systems: piecemeal development. Comes a point where it can't be tweaked anymore. Hope with RDA is that new system would be created.

Harvard:
Many Harvard catalogers in Connexion
